<p>Your information, your passwords, your bank account numbers, your family memories or your business secrets&#8230; What are these worth to you?<br><br>Well access to that information (your stolen credentials), depending on who is buying and selling it, could cost as little as $2.00 on the dark web. Imagine, all of your data, your bank account, your photos, your business secrets, whatever they may be, is worth initially $2.00 to someone. And if your computer isn&#8217;t secured, and you don&#8217;t have a good policy in place to mitigate attacks, then data that is priceless to you, could be profit for someone else. <br><br>If you don&#8217;t have a plan in place to secure your computer(s), or your network, why not? If you need help securing your computers and ensuring preventative maintenance is performed, let a professional help. Contact us today to see what we can offer you or your business.</p>

<p>Some of us know how to tell the difference between a legitimate e-mail and a fake/spam e-mail, but do your employees know?<br></p>



<p>Phishing e-mails are quick to get through the spam filters and often-times deceiving to most casual computer users. Having e-mails such as &#8220;ce0@yourcompny.com&#8221; or &#8220;John@micr5oft.com&#8221; can be deceiving depending on the e-mail application used. Does your company provide anti-malware solutions that include e-mail scanning for phishing attempts? Does your company also run &#8220;Phishing&#8221; campaigns to test your employees if they will open the e-mail and link inside of the e-mail? <br><br>At Init Cyber, we provide solutions for phishing attempts, and we can also run phishing campaigns at a random interval to test your employees (and even you). If your business is running without solutions in place to help mitigate phishing and other e-mail related attacks, how can you ensure your employees aren&#8217;t passing out your company credit card information, or log-in information to your bank accounts? What about passing out credentials for their own computers which can later lead to a breach?<br><br>Talk to the experts, contact us today!</p>

<p>Did you know your personal information is under attack everyday? If you didn&#8217;t I invite you to come out from under the rock you are living under because your information, as much as mine, is highly valuable in the right hands.<br><br>The Healthcare sector is one of the most highly sought after targets, because of the information they have . As of recent, hackers have not only targeted healthcare for the information they have, but YOUR information too (and they are even attacking you directly through the information obtained from healthcare breaches.<br><br>In 2018, Healthcare breaches grew 400% and were almost half of the data breaches in the world. That number unfortunately continues to grow, as well as the sheer number of data breaches that occur (this could be related to the number of electronics we own now and the rate of technology expanding). Healthcare has strict guidelines to protect the information they have (HIPAA), but does your business? If you aren&#8217;t protecting your business and the information you hold, why not?</p>

<p>Data Breaches aren&#8217;t just some Hollywood theatrical computer hacker thing that you only dream of. It&#8217;s the real deal, and the truth is, it really can happen to you. The worst part? If you aren&#8217;t taking a proactive approach to your Cybersecurity, you may fall victim to those who didn&#8217;t realize it happened until it&#8217;s too late. <br><br>In 2018, 56% of breaches took MONTHS, if not longer, to discover. That&#8217;s over half of the breaches not being recognized even within the first few weeks. Bigger companies have means and ways to detect these breaches, but the threat actors going against these companies also spend more time articulating how they will complete their attack.<br><br>Smaller to mid size businesses, and even consumers, oftentimes don&#8217;t have hardly any security measures in place like major enterprises do. Let that sink in for a second&#8230; <br><br>So why trust that you business is secure when no one has made it public that you have fell victim to a data breach. Why have the mindset of &#8220;it won&#8217;t happen to me&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t need any help from IT professionals&#8221;.  Because if you aren&#8217;t securing your data, or trusting your data with the experts, how many months will it take you to discover a breach (if you even do).</p>

<p>Data breaches are unfortunately becoming the norm. Some businesses though assume that their security is &#8220;okay&#8221; and that they are &#8220;too small&#8221; to have a data breach. The truth is, if your OK with having so much risk that your network is literally just a playing ground for some script kiddie, or worse, someone who knows what they are doing, you may as well close shop. Knowing the difference between acceptable risk and operating blindly will determine how much you decide you want to shell out whenever your business spills out their customers/employees PII and/or their business secrets.<br><br>Did you know that in the US, the average cost of a data breach is between 7 and 8 million dollars? To some of the elite businesses, 8 Million dollars, while it can hurt, doesn&#8217;t hurt their pocket books as much as the PR backlash. So for your small business to mid-size enterprise, why take the risk on either and not have a Managed Service Provider help protect you?<br><br>A Managed Service Provider can help analyze your business IT assets, and not only monitor and protect what you have, but discuss with you possible solutions to help mitigate some of the risks you may not know you have. And while there is no perfect solution that will cover your technology 100% from data breaches, getting you to that true acceptable risk makes a difference between &#8220;They had all these security measures in place&#8221; to simple &#8220;willful negligence&#8221;. Trust me, you don&#8217;t want the government thinking you were willfully negligent.</p>

<p>We take a lot of things for granted, such as food/water, our health, out time, the people we associate with. Oftentimes we can sit back and think about what we take for granted and realize how fortunate we are to have these things. However, have you thought about the services we use?<br><br>For example, we take for granted that the bank we use won&#8217;t have data breaches, or that Facebook won&#8217;t sell out data (*snicker*), however none of us think about what we use and how it can affect us.<br><br>&#8220;Nearly half of consumers currently use ,or have used in the past, services of organizations that were involved in a publicly disclosed data breach&#8221;.  Let that sink in for a second. Half of us statistically use services from organizations where we know their data has been breached. So why aren&#8217;t we trying to protect ourselves?<br><br>There are so many services today that offer identity protection, and often times when identity protection is offered to us, we disregard it thinking we are safe. This false sense of hope ends up in years of cleaning up the mess someone made of your credit history.<br><br>If you haven&#8217;t already, check your credit scores, and invest in yourself to protect your identity. Then check out your services that you use and see if and when they had a breach, and what they have done to try to protect your data. It may give you a second thought on what you use.</p>

<p>Cyber Fraud is a hot market if you are into that kind of shady business. While most people are worrying about how to protect their computers, cyber criminals are taking on the mobile market by storm. More than 60% of cyber fraud originates from Mobile Devices while 80% of mobile cyber fraud comes from mobile apps. Some ways you can protect yourself (as well your assets i.e. bank accounts) is to treat it like your computer. For instance, if you get a spam e-mail on your computer, you wouldn&#8217;t open it, so why do it on your mobile device?<br><br>Furthermore, if you get any suspicious texts (ex. You won $10,000 from the the prince of xyz Country) you shouldn&#8217;t click the links. Most of these websites contain drive-by-downloads which installs the payload of the malware onto your device without you knowing. These types of malware can access your passwords you have saved on your phone, your bank account information, among other things. <br><br>Also, beware of where you download your apps from (specifically Android .apk files). What may appear as a &#8220;free&#8221; $50 app will most likely be some sort of malware that was created to benefit the criminal, not you.</p>

<p>Ever wonder how hackers can get into your computers? Your anti-virus is up to date, you have your firewall set correctly, what gives?<br><br>Did you know that 80% of hacking related breaches occur due to stolen or weak passwords. Some of these can be due to something as complex as cracking stolen hashes, to something as simple as weak passwords. Do you or your employees write down your password into a sticky note and place them on your monitor? Are you using passwords such as &#8220;Password&#8221; &#8220;abc123&#8221; or even &#8220;qwerty&#8221;? If so, STOP, you may as well not use one at all. This is equivalent to parking your car at the Cumberland Mall, putting your keys on the hood and walking inside. Sure it will keep honest people out.<br><br>So complex passwords are tough to remember, but you can make them simpler. Using different phrases such as &#8220;The big red elephant has 4 feet at the bottom and 2 ears on top!&#8221; can allow you to complicate your password without forgetting it. For instance using the phrase above could result in a password of &#8220;Tbreh4f@tb&amp;2eot!&#8221; which would complicate the password, provide length, and different character types. If you don&#8217;t feel like doing that, using a password manager is another option.<br><br>And if you feel that you don&#8217;t need complex passwords, just keep using those simple passwords, just be sure you can afford downtime if your computers fall victim to cyber attacks.</p>

<p>January 14, 2020, is the date marked by Microsoft to end it&#8217;s support for Windows 7, thus hoping to push everyone to Windows 10. While this may seem daunting to a few, there are several options you can take. First and foremost, you can follow the recommendations set forth by Microsoft <a href="http://Here">here</a>, However these seem a bit drastic (making you buy a new PC from the start).<br><br>First check your computer system and see if it can support Windows 10. </p>



<ul><li>Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC.</li><li>RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit.</li><li>Hard disk space: 16 GB for 32-bit OS 20 GB for 64-bit OS.</li></ul>



<p>If it does support it, then great, you can upgrade to Windows 10 to keep getting updates.<br>But if it doesn&#8217;t , this doesn&#8217;t mean you need to quickly upgrade to Windows 10 before January 14 or else your computer will fail to operate. This is simply the last date for updating your system. Ensure your system is up to date and your data is backed up. From there, do consider purchasing a new computer within the next few months (unless you want to switch to Linux, which I will say is a fun route for the adventurous). If you don&#8217;t however, don&#8217;t expect your system to be secure (try running XP, finding updates  and seeing what kind of vulnerabilities exist today for it).</p>
