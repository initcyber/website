<p>Ever wonder how hackers can get into your computers? Your anti-virus is up to date, you have your firewall set correctly, what gives?<br><br>Did you know that 80% of hacking related breaches occur due to stolen or weak passwords. Some of these can be due to something as complex as cracking stolen hashes, to something as simple as weak passwords. Do you or your employees write down your password into a sticky note and place them on your monitor? Are you using passwords such as &#8220;Password&#8221; &#8220;abc123&#8221; or even &#8220;qwerty&#8221;? If so, STOP, you may as well not use one at all. This is equivalent to parking your car at the Cumberland Mall, putting your keys on the hood and walking inside. Sure it will keep honest people out.<br><br>So complex passwords are tough to remember, but you can make them simpler. Using different phrases such as &#8220;The big red elephant has 4 feet at the bottom and 2 ears on top!&#8221; can allow you to complicate your password without forgetting it. For instance using the phrase above could result in a password of &#8220;Tbreh4f@tb&amp;2eot!&#8221; which would complicate the password, provide length, and different character types. If you don&#8217;t feel like doing that, using a password manager is another option.<br><br>And if you feel that you don&#8217;t need complex passwords, just keep using those simple passwords, just be sure you can afford downtime if your computers fall victim to cyber attacks.</p>

<p>January 14, 2020, is the date marked by Microsoft to end it&#8217;s support for Windows 7, thus hoping to push everyone to Windows 10. While this may seem daunting to a few, there are several options you can take. First and foremost, you can follow the recommendations set forth by Microsoft <a href="http://Here">here</a>, However these seem a bit drastic (making you buy a new PC from the start).<br><br>First check your computer system and see if it can support Windows 10. </p>



<ul><li>Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC.</li><li>RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit.</li><li>Hard disk space: 16 GB for 32-bit OS 20 GB for 64-bit OS.</li></ul>



<p>If it does support it, then great, you can upgrade to Windows 10 to keep getting updates.<br>But if it doesn&#8217;t , this doesn&#8217;t mean you need to quickly upgrade to Windows 10 before January 14 or else your computer will fail to operate. This is simply the last date for updating your system. Ensure your system is up to date and your data is backed up. From there, do consider purchasing a new computer within the next few months (unless you want to switch to Linux, which I will say is a fun route for the adventurous). If you don&#8217;t however, don&#8217;t expect your system to be secure (try running XP, finding updates  and seeing what kind of vulnerabilities exist today for it).</p>

<p>Do you find yourself constantly having to reset your password because you forgot it? What about needing that extra secure 14 character password with upper/lower, special characters and numbers? Tired of losing productivity because of waiting for that password reset email? Or for your system administrator to reset your password?<br><br>Password managers, when used correctly, can be that solution for not only keeping your passwords secure, but also saving you time. Three products I have used and recommend are SecureSafe (<a href="https://www.securesafe.com">https://www.securesafe.com</a>), LastPass (<a href="https://www.lastpass.com">https://www.lastpass.com</a>) and Dashlane (<a href="https://www.dashlane.com">https://www.dashlane.com</a>), but other solutions work just as well. (No we are not affiliated with any of these companies).<br><br>These password managers all offer both free tiers and paid tiers, along with business pricing. Some even offer secure storage on their cloud servers, although with limited data unless you pay.<br><br>When looking for password managers, be sure to look for one that offer at least 128-bit AES Encryption. Also look for one that can generate complex passwords for you as an added bonus. Be sure to read the reviews of any password managers you choose as well.  Additional security features like 2FA (2 Factor Authentication) and other authentication methods (such as using a Yubi-Key) will provide one more layer of security.<br><br>And remember, your password manager is only as secure as the password you use to secure it. Don&#8217;t expect your password manager to be secure when you use &#8220;password123&#8221; to lock it. </p>

<p> How slow is your internet speed? Are you constantly banging on the keyboard waiting for a webpage to load or for your download to complete? When was the last time you checked out your wireless router? <br><br>While most people just opt in for whatever their network provider gives them (oftentimes getting something other than &#8220;Bottom Tier&#8221;) few look at their wireless router. New wireless standards come out every day, which way outperforms the &#8220;fast&#8221; wireless solutions from a decade ago. <br><br>Wireless AC is the new &#8220;standard&#8221; when it comes to having wireless internet, and if you are still using &#8220;Wireless G&#8221;, your bottleneck may be your router. Best of all, these routers can be had for under $100 (for example, Netgears Nighthawk R6700 on Amazon is $85 at the time of this posting).<br><br>So if you are having trouble with your internet speeds, but haven&#8217;t upgraded your equipment in a while, be sure to see if your wireless router is up to todays standard. If you need help contact Init Cyber Solutions (info@initcyber.com), and let us figure out what is slowing you down. </p>

<p>Web Browsing Tips to make your life easier:</p>



<p> While there are 
many tips and tricks you can learn about your computer, often times we 
find ourselves mostly cruising the internet on our browser of choice. 
Several shortcuts can streamline this experience, especially if you like
 to multi-task and have a lot of tabs open like me. Here are a few 
favorite shortcuts I use everyday:</p>



<p> Tired of clicking through your open tabs and want a faster way to switch? Use &#8216;Ctrl + Tab&#8217; just like you would alt tab.</p>



<p>
 Do you need one of your tabs to be your personal (Temporary) notepad to
 jot quick notes down? Type this into your browser (without quotes) &#8211; &#8221; 
data:text/html, &lt;html contenteditable&gt; &#8220;</p>



<p> Are you a Chrome 
Browser user? Hold down the &#8216;S&#8217; key while right clicking on an image, 
and Chrome will perform a search by the image.</p>



<p> Need to open a new
 tab quickly without using your mouse? Use &#8216;Ctrl + T&#8217;. Subsequently to 
close the tab you are currently on, use &#8216;Ctrl + W&#8217;. If you accidentally 
close a tab and need it back open, &#8216;Ctrl + shift + T&#8217; will reopen your 
last tab. </p>



<p> The same concept with New Windows, &#8216;Ctrl + N&#8217; and &#8216;Ctrl + shift + N&#8217; will open and close windows.</p>



<p>  Finally, if you need to zoom in or out on a webpage, use &#8216;Ctrl&#8217; and the  &#8216;+&#8217; or &#8216;-&#8216; key to zoom in or out. If you want to have the normal  webpage view, use &#8216;Ctrl + 0&#8217; (Zero).</p>
