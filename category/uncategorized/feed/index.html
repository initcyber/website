<p>Data Breaches aren&#8217;t just some Hollywood theatrical computer hacker thing that you only dream of. It&#8217;s the real deal, and the truth is, it really can happen to you. The worst part? If you aren&#8217;t taking a proactive approach to your Cybersecurity, you may fall victim to those who didn&#8217;t realize it happened until it&#8217;s too late. <br><br>In 2018, 56% of breaches took MONTHS, if not longer, to discover. That&#8217;s over half of the breaches not being recognized even within the first few weeks. Bigger companies have means and ways to detect these breaches, but the threat actors going against these companies also spend more time articulating how they will complete their attack.<br><br>Smaller to mid size businesses, and even consumers, oftentimes don&#8217;t have hardly any security measures in place like major enterprises do. Let that sink in for a second&#8230; <br><br>So why trust that you business is secure when no one has made it public that you have fell victim to a data breach. Why have the mindset of &#8220;it won&#8217;t happen to me&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t need any help from IT professionals&#8221;.  Because if you aren&#8217;t securing your data, or trusting your data with the experts, how many months will it take you to discover a breach (if you even do).</p>

<p>We take a lot of things for granted, such as food/water, our health, out time, the people we associate with. Oftentimes we can sit back and think about what we take for granted and realize how fortunate we are to have these things. However, have you thought about the services we use?<br><br>For example, we take for granted that the bank we use won&#8217;t have data breaches, or that Facebook won&#8217;t sell out data (*snicker*), however none of us think about what we use and how it can affect us.<br><br>&#8220;Nearly half of consumers currently use ,or have used in the past, services of organizations that were involved in a publicly disclosed data breach&#8221;.  Let that sink in for a second. Half of us statistically use services from organizations where we know their data has been breached. So why aren&#8217;t we trying to protect ourselves?<br><br>There are so many services today that offer identity protection, and often times when identity protection is offered to us, we disregard it thinking we are safe. This false sense of hope ends up in years of cleaning up the mess someone made of your credit history.<br><br>If you haven&#8217;t already, check your credit scores, and invest in yourself to protect your identity. Then check out your services that you use and see if and when they had a breach, and what they have done to try to protect your data. It may give you a second thought on what you use.</p>

<p>Cyber Fraud is a hot market if you are into that kind of shady business. While most people are worrying about how to protect their computers, cyber criminals are taking on the mobile market by storm. More than 60% of cyber fraud originates from Mobile Devices while 80% of mobile cyber fraud comes from mobile apps. Some ways you can protect yourself (as well your assets i.e. bank accounts) is to treat it like your computer. For instance, if you get a spam e-mail on your computer, you wouldn&#8217;t open it, so why do it on your mobile device?<br><br>Furthermore, if you get any suspicious texts (ex. You won $10,000 from the the prince of xyz Country) you shouldn&#8217;t click the links. Most of these websites contain drive-by-downloads which installs the payload of the malware onto your device without you knowing. These types of malware can access your passwords you have saved on your phone, your bank account information, among other things. <br><br>Also, beware of where you download your apps from (specifically Android .apk files). What may appear as a &#8220;free&#8221; $50 app will most likely be some sort of malware that was created to benefit the criminal, not you.</p>
