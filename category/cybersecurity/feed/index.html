<p>Your information, your passwords, your bank account numbers, your family memories or your business secrets&#8230; What are these worth to you?<br><br>Well access to that information (your stolen credentials), depending on who is buying and selling it, could cost as little as $2.00 on the dark web. Imagine, all of your data, your bank account, your photos, your business secrets, whatever they may be, is worth initially $2.00 to someone. And if your computer isn&#8217;t secured, and you don&#8217;t have a good policy in place to mitigate attacks, then data that is priceless to you, could be profit for someone else. <br><br>If you don&#8217;t have a plan in place to secure your computer(s), or your network, why not? If you need help securing your computers and ensuring preventative maintenance is performed, let a professional help. Contact us today to see what we can offer you or your business.</p>

<p>Some of us know how to tell the difference between a legitimate e-mail and a fake/spam e-mail, but do your employees know?<br></p>



<p>Phishing e-mails are quick to get through the spam filters and often-times deceiving to most casual computer users. Having e-mails such as &#8220;ce0@yourcompny.com&#8221; or &#8220;John@micr5oft.com&#8221; can be deceiving depending on the e-mail application used. Does your company provide anti-malware solutions that include e-mail scanning for phishing attempts? Does your company also run &#8220;Phishing&#8221; campaigns to test your employees if they will open the e-mail and link inside of the e-mail? <br><br>At Init Cyber, we provide solutions for phishing attempts, and we can also run phishing campaigns at a random interval to test your employees (and even you). If your business is running without solutions in place to help mitigate phishing and other e-mail related attacks, how can you ensure your employees aren&#8217;t passing out your company credit card information, or log-in information to your bank accounts? What about passing out credentials for their own computers which can later lead to a breach?<br><br>Talk to the experts, contact us today!</p>

<p>Did you know your personal information is under attack everyday? If you didn&#8217;t I invite you to come out from under the rock you are living under because your information, as much as mine, is highly valuable in the right hands.<br><br>The Healthcare sector is one of the most highly sought after targets, because of the information they have . As of recent, hackers have not only targeted healthcare for the information they have, but YOUR information too (and they are even attacking you directly through the information obtained from healthcare breaches.<br><br>In 2018, Healthcare breaches grew 400% and were almost half of the data breaches in the world. That number unfortunately continues to grow, as well as the sheer number of data breaches that occur (this could be related to the number of electronics we own now and the rate of technology expanding). Healthcare has strict guidelines to protect the information they have (HIPAA), but does your business? If you aren&#8217;t protecting your business and the information you hold, why not?</p>

<p>Data breaches are unfortunately becoming the norm. Some businesses though assume that their security is &#8220;okay&#8221; and that they are &#8220;too small&#8221; to have a data breach. The truth is, if your OK with having so much risk that your network is literally just a playing ground for some script kiddie, or worse, someone who knows what they are doing, you may as well close shop. Knowing the difference between acceptable risk and operating blindly will determine how much you decide you want to shell out whenever your business spills out their customers/employees PII and/or their business secrets.<br><br>Did you know that in the US, the average cost of a data breach is between 7 and 8 million dollars? To some of the elite businesses, 8 Million dollars, while it can hurt, doesn&#8217;t hurt their pocket books as much as the PR backlash. So for your small business to mid-size enterprise, why take the risk on either and not have a Managed Service Provider help protect you?<br><br>A Managed Service Provider can help analyze your business IT assets, and not only monitor and protect what you have, but discuss with you possible solutions to help mitigate some of the risks you may not know you have. And while there is no perfect solution that will cover your technology 100% from data breaches, getting you to that true acceptable risk makes a difference between &#8220;They had all these security measures in place&#8221; to simple &#8220;willful negligence&#8221;. Trust me, you don&#8217;t want the government thinking you were willfully negligent.</p>

<p>Ever wonder how hackers can get into your computers? Your anti-virus is up to date, you have your firewall set correctly, what gives?<br><br>Did you know that 80% of hacking related breaches occur due to stolen or weak passwords. Some of these can be due to something as complex as cracking stolen hashes, to something as simple as weak passwords. Do you or your employees write down your password into a sticky note and place them on your monitor? Are you using passwords such as &#8220;Password&#8221; &#8220;abc123&#8221; or even &#8220;qwerty&#8221;? If so, STOP, you may as well not use one at all. This is equivalent to parking your car at the Cumberland Mall, putting your keys on the hood and walking inside. Sure it will keep honest people out.<br><br>So complex passwords are tough to remember, but you can make them simpler. Using different phrases such as &#8220;The big red elephant has 4 feet at the bottom and 2 ears on top!&#8221; can allow you to complicate your password without forgetting it. For instance using the phrase above could result in a password of &#8220;Tbreh4f@tb&amp;2eot!&#8221; which would complicate the password, provide length, and different character types. If you don&#8217;t feel like doing that, using a password manager is another option.<br><br>And if you feel that you don&#8217;t need complex passwords, just keep using those simple passwords, just be sure you can afford downtime if your computers fall victim to cyber attacks.</p>

<p>Ransomware, probably one of the most feared types of malware there is. Have you ever wondered what to do when your company is hit with Ransomware? What happens to your business when you are hit with a heavy price tag to save your computer? Now what if it has affected your entire network?<br><br>Can&#8217;t answer most of these questions? Neither can most people who take care of their own IT needs without the experience and backing of a professional.<br><br>The average requested Ransom after a small business breach of $4300.00. And worst of all, even if you pay for this there is NO guarantee that they will follow through. Then you have the constant worry of whether or not they will strike again&#8230; (News Flash: They got in, you paid, do you think they won&#8217;t leave a file behind to give them access and do it again?)<br><br>Init Cyber can not only provide you with preventative measures to help stop attacks like this, but in the event that Ransomware does hit, we have solutions to get your data up and running without having to fork out cash to hackers.<br><br>Of course, you could always just keep a certain amount of throwaway cash, pay up, and hope that the hacker(s) don&#8217;t do it again.</p>

<p>When it comes to your company, how secure is your network? Do you have certain policies and practices in place that help mitigate cyber attacks and breeches? If you don&#8217;t have policies or any plans in place, the questions is&#8230; Why not? According to Forrester, 2/3 of the organizations out there have averaged five (5!!) or more breaches in the past two years.<br><br>Now you may be thinking &#8220;What? Not me, not my business&#8221; but do you truly understand what a data breech is?  Anytime your information is accessed without prior authorization from you or your company is considered a breach. Often times this occurs and you may not even realize it.  What can happen to your business if the data that is breached contained any PII (Personally Identifiable Information i.e. Social Security Numbers, etc) or your business inside secrets? Lets just say your bottom line just got a touch smaller&#8230;<br><br>So if you don&#8217;t have a dedicated IT staff or company assisting with your IT needs, and think that your data is secured without the help of a professional, then how small are you willing to let your bottom line go? </p>

<p>Do you find yourself constantly having to reset your password because you forgot it? What about needing that extra secure 14 character password with upper/lower, special characters and numbers? Tired of losing productivity because of waiting for that password reset email? Or for your system administrator to reset your password?<br><br>Password managers, when used correctly, can be that solution for not only keeping your passwords secure, but also saving you time. Three products I have used and recommend are SecureSafe (<a href="https://www.securesafe.com">https://www.securesafe.com</a>), LastPass (<a href="https://www.lastpass.com">https://www.lastpass.com</a>) and Dashlane (<a href="https://www.dashlane.com">https://www.dashlane.com</a>), but other solutions work just as well. (No we are not affiliated with any of these companies).<br><br>These password managers all offer both free tiers and paid tiers, along with business pricing. Some even offer secure storage on their cloud servers, although with limited data unless you pay.<br><br>When looking for password managers, be sure to look for one that offer at least 128-bit AES Encryption. Also look for one that can generate complex passwords for you as an added bonus. Be sure to read the reviews of any password managers you choose as well.  Additional security features like 2FA (2 Factor Authentication) and other authentication methods (such as using a Yubi-Key) will provide one more layer of security.<br><br>And remember, your password manager is only as secure as the password you use to secure it. Don&#8217;t expect your password manager to be secure when you use &#8220;password123&#8221; to lock it. </p>

<p> With the &#8220;price tag&#8221; on data ranging from minimal to &#8220;Business Critical&#8221; or &#8220;Irreplaceable&#8221;  what do you value your data at?</p>



<p>Today, Data breaches, loss of information due to being hacked, or even worse, ransomware are on the continual rise. One &#8220;piece of mind&#8221; that you can have is utilizing data backups.</p>



<p>Trust me, from what I have seen, those who claim they are performing &#8220;Data Backups&#8221; really aren&#8217;t. The act of simply copying and pasting onto an external hard drive isn&#8217;t a good solution for data backup. Worse yet, some just have two copies of the data on the same hard drive and call it a backup.</p>



<p>What do you value your data at? Is your data business critical data or some family photos? Would you be able to get them back if your computer crashed? What if your building caught fire, floods or lightning strikes it?</p>



<p>An Off-site data solution is highly recommended in addition to any local backups you conduct (i.e. on an external hard drive). Whether you choose the &#8220;Cloud&#8221; to host your data, or performing backups once a month/week/day ensure you follow the 3-2-1 rule. You need three (3) Copies of data. Two (2) of them need to be on different storage medias other than where you primarily store it. Finally one (1) of these storage medias needs to be offsite. Following this rule at a minimum, coupled with differential, incremental, or full backups at regular intervals will help secure the availability of your data. Your data, whether it is business critical information or digital photos/memories are just as important to a company as it is to a consumer.</p>



<p>So once again, how secure is your data? </p>

<p>Are
 you using 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) for any of your online needs 
(e-mail, bank accounts, websites you visit with your sensitive 
information)? If you aren&#8217;t you really need to be. Even though hackers 
can possibly crack your password, having a TOTP/HOTP Two Factor 
Authentication Solution is that extra step that a hacker has to take to 
get into your information. </p>



<p> One tool I use for several different sites that support it is Authy, and their Desktop and Mobile solutions make 2FA easier.</p>



<p>Check out this article from Authy.</p>
