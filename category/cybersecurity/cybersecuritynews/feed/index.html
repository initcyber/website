<p>Some of us know how to tell the difference between a legitimate e-mail and a fake/spam e-mail, but do your employees know?<br></p>



<p>Phishing e-mails are quick to get through the spam filters and often-times deceiving to most casual computer users. Having e-mails such as &#8220;ce0@yourcompny.com&#8221; or &#8220;John@micr5oft.com&#8221; can be deceiving depending on the e-mail application used. Does your company provide anti-malware solutions that include e-mail scanning for phishing attempts? Does your company also run &#8220;Phishing&#8221; campaigns to test your employees if they will open the e-mail and link inside of the e-mail? <br><br>At Init Cyber, we provide solutions for phishing attempts, and we can also run phishing campaigns at a random interval to test your employees (and even you). If your business is running without solutions in place to help mitigate phishing and other e-mail related attacks, how can you ensure your employees aren&#8217;t passing out your company credit card information, or log-in information to your bank accounts? What about passing out credentials for their own computers which can later lead to a breach?<br><br>Talk to the experts, contact us today!</p>

<p>When it comes to your company, how secure is your network? Do you have certain policies and practices in place that help mitigate cyber attacks and breeches? If you don&#8217;t have policies or any plans in place, the questions is&#8230; Why not? According to Forrester, 2/3 of the organizations out there have averaged five (5!!) or more breaches in the past two years.<br><br>Now you may be thinking &#8220;What? Not me, not my business&#8221; but do you truly understand what a data breech is?  Anytime your information is accessed without prior authorization from you or your company is considered a breach. Often times this occurs and you may not even realize it.  What can happen to your business if the data that is breached contained any PII (Personally Identifiable Information i.e. Social Security Numbers, etc) or your business inside secrets? Lets just say your bottom line just got a touch smaller&#8230;<br><br>So if you don&#8217;t have a dedicated IT staff or company assisting with your IT needs, and think that your data is secured without the help of a professional, then how small are you willing to let your bottom line go? </p>
